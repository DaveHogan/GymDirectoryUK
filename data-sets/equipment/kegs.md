# Equipment: Kegs

## Description
 Kegs, in the context of strength training and strongman competitions, are heavy, cylindrical containers traditionally used for storing and transporting liquids, repurposed as weights. They are often filled with water, sand, or lead shot to vary the weight. Kegs are used for lifting, carrying, and throwing exercises, testing an athlete's strength, grip, and endurance.

## Common Exercises
<ul><li>Keg carries for distance or time for endurance and strength.</li><li>Keg tosses for explosive power and coordination.</li><li>Overhead keg presses for upper body strength.</li><li>Deadlifts or squats with the keg for leg and back strength.</li></ul>

## Skill Level
<ul><li>Suitable for various skill levels, with the ability to adjust the weight inside the keg.</li><li>Beginners should start with lighter kegs and focus on form before progressing to heavier weights.</li></ul>
