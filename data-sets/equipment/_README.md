Equipment data is used for displaying information about the individual piece of equipment and for assigning which gyms have what equipment available.

# Format

* **File name:** (without .md extension) is the unique identifier.

* **Formating:** Basic HTML for formatting is supported under each title, but future reviews will use markdown.

Please review [_EXAMPLE.md](https://github.com/DaveHogan/GymDirectoryUK/blob/main/data-sets/equipment/_EXAMPLE.md) file for further details or any other existing equipment file.

# Usage
