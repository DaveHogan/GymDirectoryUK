# Equipment: Tyres

## Description
Tyres, particularly large tractor or truck tyres, are used in strength and fitness for flipping, striking with hammers, or jumping in and out, building strength and endurance. Tyre training is excellent for building strength, power, endurance, and coordination.

## Equipment Type
Functional

## How To Use
<ul><li><strong>Tyre Flips</strong>: Squat down and grip the underside of the tyre.

Hit the tyre on alternating sides with controlled swings.</li><li><strong>Jumping Exercises</strong>: Use the tyre as a platform for jumps, stepping up or leaping onto and off the tyre.</li></ul>

## Benefits
<ul><li>Builds functional strength and muscle endurance.</li><li>Enhances cardiovascular fitness, especially during high-intensity workouts.</li><li>Develops explosive power, particularly with flipping and hammer swings.</li><li>Improves coordination and balance.</li></ul>

## Targeted Muscles
<ul><li>Tyre flips engage the legs, core, back, and arms.</li><li>Sledgehammer workouts primarily target the upper body, core, and obliques.</li><li>Jumping exercises focus on the legs and core.</li></ul>

## Common Exercises
<ul><li>Tyre flips for full-body strength and power.</li><li>Sledgehammer hits for upper body conditioning and core stability.</li><li>Box jumps or step-ups using the tyre for lower body strength and cardio.</li></ul>

## Skill Level
<ul><li>Suitable for various skill levels, with different sizes and weights of tyres available.</li><li>Beginners should start with smaller, lighter tyres and focus on form.</li></ul>

## Safety Tips
<ul><li>Ensure a firm grip and proper lifting when flipping tyres to avoid back injuries.</li><li>Avoid using biceps to lift the tyre to avoid tears</li><li>When using a sledgehammer, wear gloves and ensure a secure grip.</li><li>Check the surrounding area for enough space and a safe surface, especially when performing jumps.</li></ul>

## Alternatives
<ul><li>Sandbags or medicine balls for similar lifting and throwing exercises.</li><li>Plyometric boxes for jump training.</li><li>Barbells or dumbbells for more traditional strength training.</li></ul>
