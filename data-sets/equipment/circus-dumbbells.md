# Equipment: Circus Dumbbells

## Description
<p>Circus Dumbbells are specialised pieces of equipment predominantly used in strongman competitions. They are characterised by their oversized, often globe-shaped ends and thick handles, making them more challenging to balance and lift than regular dumbbells. Circus Dumbbells are used for testing grip strength, shoulder power, and overall upper-body control. Similar to Monster dumbells, the key difference is that Monster Dumbbells can usually be plate-loaded, whereas Circus Dumbells tend to be solid cast lumps.<br></p>
